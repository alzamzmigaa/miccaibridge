  <h4> Bridging Regulatory Science and Medical Imaging Evaluation </h4>
</center> 
     <p>
      While regulatory bodies race to establish standards for emerging AI technologies (e.g., generative AI, autonomous AI, continual learning), establishing such regulations remains challenging without comprehensive understanding and rigorous evaluation of these innovations; the principle <strong>“If we cannot evaluate it, we cannot regulate it.”</strong> underscores this dependency, making regulation and evaluation intrinsically linked.
    </p>
  <p>
    The lack of robust evaluation frameworks introduces both challenges and opportunities within regulatory science, a field dedicated to developing tools and methodologies to assess and monitor the performance of AI-enabled or AI-powered medical devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    This workshop aims to introduce AI regulatory science to the MICCAI community and provide a platform for researchers, clinicians, and regulators to discuss algorithmic, technical, and policy challenges and collaboratively develop rigorous solutions for the safe and effective deployment of AI in healthcare. In addition, this workshop will provide an educational platform to highlight the often-overlooked importance of regulatory aspects and evaluation in AI research.
