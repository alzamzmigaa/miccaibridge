Do you wonder how we can rigorously evaluate and effectively regulate rapidly emerging AI technologies?<br>
  Are you working on building evaluation frameworks or tackling the regulatory challenges of deploying AI in clinical practice?<br>
  Are you developing methods to ensure that AI models are not just innovative, but also safe, reliable, and ready for real-world use?<br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0;">
    Then BRIDGE is the right place for your work!

  This workshop is dedicated to connecting the fast-moving world of AI innovation with the rigorous demands of evaluation and the growing challenges of AI regulation. As technologies such as generative AI and autonomous agents continue to evolve at an accelerating pace, regulatory bodies face a pressing question:<br>
 <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 10px 0;">
    How can we regulate what we donâ€™t yet know how to evaluate?
  </div><br>

  BRIDGE offers a collaborative forum for researchers, clinicians, and regulators to explore how we can better align technical development with robust evaluation methods and regulatory standards..<br><br>

  We invite submissions from individuals across the globe, including those in academia, industry, and regulatory bodies to discuss current challenges or propose new methods for evaluating and regulating AI medical technologies. Diverse perspectives are necessary to addressing the complex challenges at the intersection of AI, evaluation, and regulation.

  <h4 class="pageTitle" style="color: #2c3e50;"> Topics of Interest include, but not limited to: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Robust evaluation methods or regulatory frameworks.</li>
    <li>Papers highlighting the disconnect between AI development, evaluation metrics, and regulatory science.</li>
    <li>Theoretical or empirical studies identifying gaps between current evaluation practices for medical AI and regulatory requirements.</li>
    <li>Novel algorithmic approaches designed with regulatory alignment in mind.</li>
    <li>Perspective or position papers addressing open problems, negative results, or flawed practices in AI development that affect regulatory alignment and patient safety.</li>
    <li>Evaluation and regulation of cutting-edge technologies such as  generative AI, LLMs, and autonomous systems, particularly in clinical or high-stakes environments.</li>
    <li>Post-market monitoring and regulation: ensuring AI systems remain safe and effective after deployment.</li>
    <li>Empirical studies assessing AI readiness for clinical deployment.</li>
    <li>Underexplored regulatory questions with direct implications for patient safety.</li>
    <li> Regulatory science across countries: highlighting international differences and commonalities to inform global alignment efforts.</li>
  </ul><br>

  We welcome any submission at the intersection of medical AI evaluation and regulatory science.<br><br>
